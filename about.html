        <h1>About Abdul Abdi</h1>

        <p>
          My name is Abdul Abdi. I am a parent, community advocate, and the current
          Minneapolis Public Schools Board Director representing District 1.
          I bring strong experience in public service, financial leadership,
          and community engagement, and I am committed to ensuring every student
          has the opportunity to succeed.
        </p>

        <p>
          I currently serve as Chair of the Finance Committee, where I work to
          strengthen classrooms, support educators, and expand student programs.
          As a lifelong advocate and a parent, I understand firsthand the importance
          of safe, inclusive, and high-quality public schools.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am running for re-election to continue improving student achievement,
          listening to families, supporting our educators, and delivering results
          for our students and neighborhoods.
        </p>

      <!-- Right Column -->
      <div class="card" id="why-running">
        <h3>Why I’m Running Again</h3>

        <p>
          I am running for re-election to ensure that every student receives a
          high-quality education and the opportunities to thrive in school and beyond.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our schools are at the heart of our neighborhoods, and Minneapolis is
          strongest when we come together to support them. When families, educators,
          and community leaders work side by side, our students and communities grow stronger.
        </p>

        <p>
          I remain committed to listening to families, supporting our educators,
          and working collaboratively to ensure every student feels valued,
          challenged, and prepared for the future.
