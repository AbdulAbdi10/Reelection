      <h2>About Abdul</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Abdul Abdi. I am a parent, community advocate, and the current Minneapolis Public Schools Board Director representing District 1. I bring strong experience in public service, financial leadership, and community engagement, and I am committed to ensuring every student has the opportunity to succeed.
 </p>

        I am running for re-election to ensure that every student receives a high-quality education and the opportunities to thrive in school and beyond.

 </p>
 <p>
  Our schools are at the heart of our neighborhoods, and Minneapolis is strongest when we come together to support them. When families, educators, and community leaders work side by side, our students and communities grow stronger.

    <h2>My vison for Minneapolis Public Schools: </h2>
    <p>
      I am running for re-election to continue serving as a strong voice for our students, families, educators, and community. Having lived in Northeast Minneapolis for nearly two decades, this community is my home, and I care deeply about its future.
    </p>
   <p> With your support, we have made meaningful progress in strengthening our schools, supporting our educators, and expanding opportunities for our students. But our work is not complete. That is why I am running again—to keep moving forward together.
</p>
    <p>My vision remains focused on safe, welcoming, and well-supported schools that provide a high-quality education from Pre-K through 12th grade. Every child deserves the tools, support, and opportunities they need to succeed in school and beyond.
</p>
<p>
I am committed to listening to families, partnering with educators, and advocating for the resources our schools need. I believe in strong literacy and math instruction, meaningful family engagement, and investing in the people who support our students every day.

</p>
<p>Improving our schools takes teamwork. With your trust and continued support, I will keep working to put students first and build brighter futures for our families.
</p>  
 <p><strong>Together, we will move forward.</strong></p>
