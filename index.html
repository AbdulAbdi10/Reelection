    <h2>Vision for the District</h2>

    <p>
      I am running for re-election to continue serving as a strong voice for our students, families, educators, and community.
      Having lived in Northeast Minneapolis for nearly two decades, this community is my home, and I care deeply about its future.
    </p>

    <p>
      With your support, we have made meaningful progress in strengthening our schools, supporting our educators, and expanding opportunities for our students.
      But our work is not complete. That is why I am running again—to keep building on this progress and moving our district forward together.
    </p>

    <p>
      My vision is focused on safe, welcoming, and well-supported schools that provide a high-quality education from Pre-K through 12th grade.
      Every child deserves the tools, resources, and opportunities they need to succeed in school and in life.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am committed to listening to families, partnering with educators, and advocating for strong literacy and math instruction,
      meaningful family engagement, and the support staff our schools rely on every day.
    </p>

    <p>
      Improving our schools takes teamwork. With your trust and continued support, I will continue to put students first and work tirelessly
      to build brighter futures for our families.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Together, we will move forward.</strong></p>
