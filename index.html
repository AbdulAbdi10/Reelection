      <h2>About Abdul</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Abdul Abdi. I am a parent, community advocate, and the current Minneapolis Public Schools Board Director representing District 1.
        I bring strong experience in public service, financial leadership, and community engagement, and I am committed to ensuring every student has
        the opportunity to succeed.
      </p>
      <p>
        I currently serve as Chair of the Finance Committee, where I work to strengthen classrooms, support educators, and expand student programs.
        As a lifelong advocate and a parent, I understand firsthand the importance of safe, inclusive, and high-quality public schools.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am running for re-election to continue improving student achievement, listening to families, supporting our educators, and delivering results
        for our students and neighborhoods.

      <h3>Why I’m Running Again</h3>
      <p>
        I am running for re-election to ensure that every student receives a high-quality education and the opportunities to thrive in school and beyond.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our schools are at the heart of our neighborhoods, and Minneapolis is strongest when we come together to support them. When families, educators,
        and community leaders work side by side, our students and communities grow stronger.
      </p>
      <p>
        I remain committed to listening to families, supporting our educators, and working collaboratively to ensure every student feels valued, challenged,
        and prepared for the future.

    <h2>Vision for the District</h2>

    <p>
      I am running for re-election to continue serving as a strong voice for our students, families, educators, and community.
      Having lived in Northeast Minneapolis for nearly two decades, this community is my home, and I care deeply about its future.
    </p>

    <p>
      With your support, we have made meaningful progress in strengthening our schools, supporting our educators, and expanding opportunities for our students.
      But our work is not complete. That is why I am running again—to keep building on this progress and moving our district forward together.
    </p>

    <p>
      My vision is focused on safe, welcoming, and well-supported schools that provide a high-quality education from Pre-K through 12th grade.
      Every child deserves the tools, resources, and opportunities they need to succeed in school and in life.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am committed to listening to families, partnering with educators, and advocating for strong literacy and math instruction,
      meaningful family engagement, and the support staff our schools rely on every day.
    </p>

    <p>
      Improving our schools takes teamwork. With your trust and continued support, I will continue to put students first and work tirelessly
      to build brighter futures for our families.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Together, we will move forward.</strong></p>
